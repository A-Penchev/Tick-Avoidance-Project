# Tick-Avoidance-Project
Introduction This GitHub repository houses the analysis of tick surveillance data in Toronto from 2013 to 2019. The motivation for this analysis stems from a personal experienceâ€”an encounter with a tick during a walk with my dog. I have since made it my life's mission to avoid these nasty little things. This incident prompted a deep dive into the available data to understand the prevalence of diseased ticks and identify high-risk areas within Toronto's parks.

About the Data The dataset used for this analysis is the most recent tick surveillance data available, spanning from 2013 to 2019. It provides valuable insights into the likelihood of a tick being diseased with Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease. Additionally, the data highlights the parks in Toronto that may pose a higher risk of tick encounters.

Analysis Objectives The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:

Assess Disease Prevalence: Analyze the dataset to determine the average likelihood of a tick being diseased with Borrelia burgdorferi during the specified timeframe.

Identify High-Risk Parks: Identify and rank the parks in Toronto with the highest recorded tick encounters, helping the community make informed decisions about where to walk and enjoy outdoor activities safely.

Repository Contents Data: The raw data used for the analysis, in CSV format, can be found in the /data directory.

Notebooks: Kaggle notebooks containing the analysis code are available in the /notebooks directory. You can explore the step-by-step process of the analysis here.

Results: Visualizations, summary statistics, and any key findings from the analysis are stored in the /results directory.

Usage Feel free to explore the analysis notebooks to gain insights into Toronto's tick surveillance data. You can reproduce the analysis by running the provided Kaggle notebooks, provided you have the necessary data.

Conclusion Understanding the prevalence of Lyme disease in ticks and identifying high-risk areas in Toronto's parks is essential for promoting public health and safety. By analyzing this data, we aim to contribute to a better-informed community, helping you and your pets enjoy outdoor activities while minimizing the risk of tick encounters.

Remember to take precautions when spending time in tick-prone areas, such as using tick repellent and performing regular tick checks, to protect yourself and your loved ones. Together we can rid the world of these annoying little buggers.
