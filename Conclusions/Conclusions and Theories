The increase in the population of ticks in Toronto in 2017 could be attributed to several factors:

Climate Conditions: Tick populations are often influenced by weather patterns. Warmer and more humid conditions can provide a favorable environment for ticks to thrive. 
Changes in climate, including milder winters and longer warm seasons, can contribute to an increase in tick populations.

Wildlife Reservoirs: Ticks often rely on wildlife hosts, such as deer and rodents, to complete their life cycle. 
If there was an increase in the population of these host species in the Toronto area, it could lead to an increase in tick numbers.

Urban Expansion and Habitat Changes: Urban development and expansion can alter natural habitats and bring humans and wildlife into closer contact with tick-infested areas. 
This can create opportunities for ticks to find new hosts and spread into urban and suburban environments.

Migration: Ticks can be carried by birds and other wildlife, allowing them to migrate to new areas. If migratory patterns of birds or other animals brought ticks to Toronto, it could lead to a sudden increase in the local tick population.

Awareness and Reporting: It's also possible that increased awareness of tick-borne diseases and better reporting mechanisms in 2017 led to the perception of a spike in tick populations. 
More people may have been reporting tick encounters, even if the actual population increase wasn't as significant as it seemed.

Ecological Changes: Changes in the local ecology, such as the abundance of certain plant species or the presence of predators that keep tick populations in check, can affect tick populations.

To determine the specific reasons for the tick population spike in Toronto in 2017, it would be necessary to conduct detailed scientific research and collect data on factors like temperature, wildlife populations, 
and tick prevalence in the area during that time period. This information could help researchers better understand the causes behind the observed increase in tick numbers. 

Additionally, public health agencies and local authorities may have more recent data and insights into tick populations and associated health risks in the Toronto area beyond my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021.
