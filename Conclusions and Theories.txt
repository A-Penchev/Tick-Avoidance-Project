The increase in the population of ticks in Toronto in 2017 could be attributed to several factors:

Climate Conditions: Tick populations are often influenced by weather patterns. Warmer and more humid conditions can provide a favorable environment for ticks to thrive. 
Changes in climate, including milder winters and longer warm seasons, can contribute to an increase in tick populations.

Wildlife Reservoirs: Ticks often rely on wildlife hosts, such as deer and rodents, to complete their life cycle. 
If there was an increase in the population of these host species in the Toronto area, it could lead to an increase in tick numbers.

Urban Expansion and Habitat Changes: Urban development and expansion can alter natural habitats and bring humans and wildlife into closer contact with tick-infested areas. 
This can create opportunities for ticks to find new hosts and spread into urban and suburban environments.

Migration: Ticks can be carried by birds and other wildlife, allowing them to migrate to new areas. If migratory patterns of birds or other animals brought ticks to Toronto, it could lead to a sudden increase in the local tick population.

Awareness and Reporting: It's also possible that increased awareness of tick-borne diseases and better reporting mechanisms in 2017 led to the perception of a spike in tick populations. 
More people may have been reporting tick encounters, even if the actual population increase wasn't as significant as it seemed.

Ecological Changes: Changes in the local ecology, such as the abundance of certain plant species or the presence of predators that keep tick populations in check, can affect tick populations.

To determine the specific reasons for the tick population spike in Toronto in 2017, it would be necessary to conduct detailed scientific research and collect data on factors like temperature, wildlife populations, 
and tick prevalence in the area during that time period. This information could help researchers better understand the causes behind the observed increase in tick numbers. 

Additionally, public health agencies and local authorities may have more recent data and insights into tick populations and associated health risks in the Toronto area beyond my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021.


The increase in the percentage of ticks found to be diseased from 26% in 2013-2016 to close to half in 2017 and beyond could be due to a combination of factors, including changes in tick-borne disease prevalence and improved testing and reporting efforts. 
Here are some potential explanations:

Increased Disease Prevalence: Tick-borne diseases are influenced by a variety of factors, including the abundance of infected host animals, tick populations, and environmental conditions. 
If the prevalence of tick-borne diseases in the Toronto area increased during this time period, it would lead to more ticks being infected.

Improved Testing: Advances in diagnostic techniques and increased awareness of tick-borne diseases can lead to more thorough testing of ticks for pathogens. As testing methods become more sensitive and widely available, more infected ticks may be detected.

Enhanced Reporting: Public health campaigns and educational efforts can encourage individuals to report tick encounters and submit ticks for testing. This can result in a more comprehensive and accurate picture of disease prevalence in tick populations.

Sampling Bias: Changes in the way ticks are sampled or collected over time can affect the results. If ticks are being sampled from different locations or environments, it could influence the percentage of infected ticks found.

Environmental Factors: Changes in the local environment, including alterations in wildlife populations or land use, can influence the prevalence of tick-borne diseases. If environmental conditions became more conducive to disease transmission, it could lead to an increase in infected ticks.

Tick Species: Different species of ticks can carry different pathogens, and their prevalence can vary over time. If there was a shift in the dominant tick species in the area, it could affect the types and prevalence of diseases found in ticks.

To determine whether the increase in diseased ticks is primarily due to rising disease prevalence or increased testing and reporting, 
it would be necessary to analyze detailed data on tick-borne disease trends, tick populations, and testing practices in the Toronto area during this specific time frame. 
Local health authorities and researchers specializing in tick-borne diseases would be best equipped to conduct such an analysis and provide insights based on the most current data available.
